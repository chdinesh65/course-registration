Abstract

 
Online course registration system is the new functional part of a student lives, providing different facilities to students in selection his own courses options. It is necessary for the collages or schools to provide a better facilities and easy records of its students, faculties, and other staff personals that keep the collage running smoothly & successfully during the alignment of courses. Recording and maintaining all these records is highly unreliable, inefficient and error-prone. It is also not economically & technically feasible to maintain these records on paper. Thus keeping the working of the manual system as the basis of our project. We have developed an online courses registration system The main aim of our project is to provide a facility to student to select his own course from all the available courses and to select his own teacher among the allocated teachers. It also aims at providing low-cost reliable automation and with better of the existing systems. The system also provides excellent security of data at every level of user-system interaction.
 
			


 
Introduction
This online courses registration system consists of three different type of login (Student, faculty, admin). We have concentrated on the student login to give the better features. The student login consists of two type of logins one is wish list registration and final registration. The wish list registration consist all the course that are available in collage/school. This wish list registration provides to main features the first one is to the management, it gives suggestions to the management about the course (which have to offer to the students in that particular semesters or time). The second feature is to the student the courses that are resisted are directly available in the main registration face. The student need not search any courses that he want in main registration process (all the courses he selected in wish list can be registered in wish list menu in main courses registration)

The students can access the registration portal online either from a computer or a smart phone, and fill the necessary information and submit it for further approval. This web application provides us with ease of access, user friendliness and transparency. On the other hand, from organizations viewpoint, it helps in maintaining transparency, data consistency, data accessibility and easy maintenance.
